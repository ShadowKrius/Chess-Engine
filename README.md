# Chess Engine




## Overview
This repository contains a Python-based chess engine designed for two-player matches as well as challenging single-player gameplay. The project leverages Pygame for the graphical interface and employs the Nega Max algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to enhance the chess engineâ€™s decision-making capabilities.

## Features
Two-Player Mode: Play chess against another human player.
- Single-Player Mode: Challenge a computer opponent with sophisticated decision-making algorithms.
- Nega Max Algorithm: Optimizes decision-making for the computer opponent.
- Alpha-Beta Pruning: Enhances efficiency by reducing the number of nodes evaluated in the game tree.

## Technologies Used
- Python: The primary programming language used for implementing the chess engine.
- Pygame: Provides the graphical interface and interactive elements.
- Nega Max Algorithm: A search algorithm that determines the best move by evaluating possible future positions.
- Alpha-Beta Pruning: An optimization technique used to reduce the number of nodes evaluated by the Nega Max algorithm.
